		<div class="BoxOut"><h2>What is KatchTV?</h2>
		<p>KatchTV is a broadcatcher; otherwise known as an Internet TV or iTV program.  With KatchTV, you can subscribe to TV channels from all over the internet, choose the episodes you're interested in, and have them download in the background.  When they're ready, just go to the
		<a href="katchtv:ready:">Ready to Watch page</a>, and you can watch the episodes from the very same program.</p></div>
		
		<div class="BoxOut"><a name="HowUse"><h2>How do I use this?</h2></a>
		<a name="BrowsingDirectories"><h3>Browsing Directories to Find Channels</h3></a>
		<p>By browsing the directory websites listed in the side panel,
		you can find many different channels to watch.</p>
		<p>Most directories are organised by category, popularity,
		some combination of these.</p>
		<h4>Steps</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Expand the Channel Directories item in the side
			panel.  To do this, just click the + button, or
			double-click the item.</li>
			
			<li>Choose a channel directory by double-clicking on
			it.  The browser pane (where you're probably reading
			this help) will load the website.</li>
			
			<li>In the directory, find a channel you like the look
			of, and then find its subscribe button, or feed link.
			
			Usually, the feed link is an orange XML button, or a
			little orange square with radiating curves suggesting
			a broadcast, like this: <img src="images/xml2.gif">
			or <img src="images/live_bookmark2.gif">.  However, in
			the directories and even on some individual sites, you
			may have to look harder for this.</li>
			
			<li>When you find the feed link, just click on it.
			After a moment, it should appear under "Subscribed
			Channels" in the side panel.</li>
			
			<li>If you can't find a direct link for a feed that
			works by clicking on it, you may be able to find out
			the URI (or URL) and copy it.  Then, click the "Add"
			button below the side panel, and paste the URI in
			there instead.</li>

			<li>Initially, the feed will appear with a temporary
			title, and no new episodes listed.  If the podcast is
			still running, then the feed should be successfully
			retrieved after a moment, and the title should appear,
			along with the number of new episodes available from
			it.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<a name="ChoosingEpisodes"><h3>Choosing Episodes to Download</h3></a>
		<p>Unlike TV, which is more like a continual stream of video,
		each podcatcher channel has many episodes, which you can
		individually choose to download and watch.  This gives you
		much more freedom in watching what you like, and ignoring what
		you don't like.  To choose episodes to watch, just follow
		these steps.</p>
		<h4>Steps</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Expand the "Subscribed Channels" item on the side
			bar so that you can see each channel.  To do this,
			just double-click it, or click the + button beside
			it.</li>
			<li>Double-click on the channel you want to view.
			This will make the channel's episodes appear in the
			main browser area (where you are probably reading this
			manual).</li>
			<li>Browse the page for episodes you like the sound of.
			With most channels, you will get a description for each
			episode.  However, some channels aren't very diligent
			about providing summaries for you.  If it's missing,
			you'll just have to guess from the enclosure name.
			Which brings us to...</li>
			<li>In each episode, you'll see a list of one or more
			enclosures.  These are the actual downloadable movies
			or audio files (actually, they could be almost
			anything!).  If there is more than one enclosure, it
			may be the same as the first, but in a different
			format that might play better on your computer.
			Another possibility is that the other enclosures might
			be different parts, like the first half of a movie,
			and the second.  Normally, the episode or the
			enclosure name will give you a hint about what you're
			being offered.</li>
			<li>Enclosures you haven't yet downloaded are shown
			with the text "Click to Download".  To download the
			enclosure of your choice, just click on its link.</li>
		</ol>
		<a name="ViewingCurrentDownloads"><h3>Viewing Current Downloads</h3></a>
		<p>To view the media that is downloading, just double-click on "Downloads in Progress", on the side bar.  Anything currently downloading will be shown there, along with the size, percentage downloaded, etc.</p>
		<p>Note that as downloads finish, they will automatically disappear from this list, and be moved to the "Ready to Watch" page (see the next section for an explanation of that).</p>
		<p>Also note that currently, only one item will download at a time.  We plan to improve on this.</p>
		
		<a name="ReadyToWatch"><h3>Choosing Something to Watch</h3></a>
		<p>To view items that have downloaded and are ready to watch,
		double-click on the "Ready to Watch" item on the side bar.
		Each downloaded movie, audio file, or other media item can be
		seen here.  You can choose to watch the item by clicking on
		it, or you can delete the item (to free up hard disk space).</p></div>
		
		<div class="BoxOut"><a name="Questions"><h2>Questions and Answers</h2></a>
		<h3>Isn't this like Democracy TV?  Isn't this like a podcatcher?  Why a whole new application?</h3>
		<p>Yes, this is largely inspired by Democracy TV, and by PenguinTV.  The major differences with KatchTV is that KatchTV is designed for KDE, and KatchTV has multiple channel guides built in.  KatchTV also takes advantage of advanced KDE technologies like KHTMLPart (the browser engine that makes Konqueror go) and the embedded media players available within KDE.</p>
		
		<h3>How Can I Rename a Subscribed Channel?</h3>
		<p>Just like most KDE apps that have columned lists, click twice slowly (don't double-click) on the name.  Change the name, and press return.  The subscribed channel list will be saved.</p>
		
		<h3>How Can I Change the Update Interval for a Subscribed Channel?</h3>
		<p>Just like editing the channel name (see above), click twice slowly (don't double-click) on the channel's "Update Mins" column. You may have to scroll the side bar horizontally to see this column.  Edit the number of minutes, and press return to save it.</p>
				
		<h3>What's currently missing/broken in KatchTV?</h3>
		<p>KatchTV is still quite new; So, there are some features currently missing.  The most important of these are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>General tidying up of the interface, and fanciness.  As KDE apps go, KatchTV is really ugly right now.  It works, which has been the main focus so far.  Hopefully I can get it to hold its own beside the modern KDE apps like Amarok though :)</li>

			<li>Crashes occasionally.  A lot of work has been done to make KatchTV more stable, but there are still a few issues remaining.  Mostly these seem to be related to unusual feeds.</li>

			<li>Sometimes loses ability to save feeds.  It seems that feeds sometimes cannot be saved -- especially after renaming the feed.  This hopefully won't cause anyone major headaches.  If you add a feed, and it doesn't appear next time you start KatchTV, this is why.  I'm working on it.</li>
		</ul></div>

		<div class="BoxOut"><a name="Thanks"><h2>Thanks</h2></a>
			<p>I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the
			Democracy TV folks for an innovative app that shows
			just how easy and world-changing a podcatcher can be.
			The first time I tried Democracy TV, it was slow and
			kludgy, but it worked well enough to show that
			traditional TV is doomed.  KatchTV is mostly just an
			attempt to make a version of Democracy TV that's a
			little faster, and fits nicely into KDE.  I'd also
			like to thank the PenguinTV team (notably Owen Williams)
			for his app; it was simple enough to get into that it
			encouraged me to contribute a (very) little bit of
			code, and really got me in the mood for writing my own
			podcatcher app.  Unfortunately, PenguinTV isn't a KDE
			app either.  Finally, I'd like to thank the Python,
			KDE, Qt, Eric3, and PyKDE/PyQt folks, for their
			products.  I mean, so far, there are about five days
			of work in this app, which is my first GUI-based KDE
			program.  Those are some great development tools!</p>
