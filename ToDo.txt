Crucial
====
* Fix deletion of channels; currently crashes
* Fix saving/loading of feeds (currently loses external datatypes; see shelve docs for solution)
* Limit number of retries for direct downloads.
* Resume bittorrent/direct downloads!
* Fix side panel resize
* Make loading and saving of config vars thread safe!  Currently reporting corruption!!
* Handle javascript: links, rather than trying to launch(!) them externally.
* Move UI-blocking stuff like feed loading to a separate UI task queue, and display
   friendly messages while it loads :)

Short-term
=======
* If no eta/average speed is available for BT (probably is), then make one by keeping a list of speeds per sec (or whatever
  the update period is) for the last x mins, and then averaging that list.
* decode to unicode from local encoding in any input (via Add dialog, for instance), since we deliberately
  ignore user's locale by default.
* Mark items in ready to watch page with "NOTE: Media has been deleted from disk."
  if the LOCAL_PATH file doesn't exist any more
* Use a separate last view variable for detecting which episodes have been seen by the viewer,
  rather than using the lastCheck field of the feed, which is updated regularly.
* Fix character set encoding/decoding in Media Items.  Currently messes
  up even simple things like apostrophes.
* TaskPool.AbortTask doesn't seem to work so well; find a better solution.
* Use config.{load,save}ConfigVar in Media.Manager._{load,save}Items
* UI Redesign, with less manual hacking, and clean use of overridden kdepyuic files.
* Status area that shows currently used diskspace, number of downloads, total download/upload rate, etc.

Medium-term
========
* Expiring items; auto-recycle space
* Support proxies everywhere (just feed/mimetype checks now) (probably by using urllib?)

Long-term
======
* Find out size of bittorrent enclosures for feed window, and display that instead of the size of the .torrent file
* Add/Edit/Delete for channel directories, and support loading and saving them
* Make it quit after playing without crashing, if this can be done without patching
  pykde, kxinewidget, or kde itself.  If not, try to track down the problem and
  report it or submit a patch.
* Wrap includes with try blocks and complain if required packages are missing
* Advanced background tasks, like recompressing videos to save diskspace, or applying filters or
  sound enhancement/normalisation, etc.
